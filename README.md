# Mood Finance Ledger

## 📘 Description

Mood Finance Ledger is a Java CLI application designed to help users track financial transactions for personal or business use. It allows users to record deposits and payments, view and filter ledger entries, and generate reports. Transactions are saved in a `.csv` file and displayed with the newest entries first.

## 💡 Interesting Code Snippet: `customSearch()`

[View the customSearch method in GitHub ›](https://github.com/Fspike1/mood-finance-ledger/blob/main/src/java/moodledger/Ledger.java#L474)


```java
if (start != null && entryDate.isBefore(start)) {
    matches = false;
}
if (vendor != null && !vendor.toLowerCase().contains(vendorSt)) {
    matches = false;
}
```

This method filters data based on user inputs. If the user leaves a field blank, that filter is skipped. It uses `LocalDate` to handle dates and checks multiple conditions in one clean loop.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- File I/O using Java's `BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`
- Working with CSV data and preventing formatting crashes
- Using `LocalDate` and `.isBefore()` / `.isAfter()` for date comparison
- Building multi-screen CLI apps using loops and switch cases
- Handling user input carefully with `Scanner` and `.nextLine()`
