# Mood Finance Ledger

## 📘 Description

Mood Finance Ledger is a Java CLI application designed to help users track financial transactions for personal or business use.

## 💡 Interesting Code Snippet: `Demos.java`

![Interesting Code Snippet in Detail](https://github.com/Fspike1/mood-finance-ledger/blob/2d282a8b723abf5dd8afa26ea88a3958971197c1/src/java/moodledger/Demos.java#L5)
```

This method filters data based on user inputs. If the user leaves a field blank, that filter is skipped. It uses `LocalDate` to handle dates and checks multiple conditions in one clean loop.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- File I/O using Java's `BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`
- Working with CSV data and preventing formatting crashes
- Using `LocalDate` and `.isBefore()` / `.isAfter()` for date comparison
- Building multi-screen CLI apps using loops and switch cases
- Handling user input carefully with `Scanner` and `.nextLine()`
