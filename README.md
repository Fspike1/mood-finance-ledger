# Mood Finance Ledger

## 📘 Description

Mood Finance Ledger is a simple Java CLI app designed to help you track where your money goes — and what it means to you. It lets you record deposits, log payments, and generate clear reports, all saved in a tidy .csv file with the newest entries first.

Inspired by the heart of a mental health app that I am working on, this tool isn’t just about finances — it’s about noticing patterns, building awareness, and staying grounded while you grow.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- File I/O using Java's `BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`
- Working with CSV data and preventing formatting crashes
- Using `LocalDate` and `.isBefore()` / `.isAfter()` for date comparison
- Building multi-screen CLI apps using loops and switch cases
- Handling user input carefully with `Scanner` and `.nextLine()`
